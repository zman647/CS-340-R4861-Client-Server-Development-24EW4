1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  To create a program that s maintanable and scalable, you want to ensure that everything is well encapsulated. For our Dashboard, we had our python CRUD module in a seperate file. This allowed all of our other next used programs to call to it and keep its functionality. This keeps the code well seperated and easily called to in the future. without rewriting the entire module repeatedly for each dashboard or program.

  2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

     To approach a problem as a computer scientist, an in depth analytical view is necessary. You want to make sure parameters are declared and all of them followed. For the difference between the Grazioso project and previous assignments, a more complex and detailed approach was taken. The Grazioso project had a more detailed want/need. The previous required only functional code to access databases etc. For this project, we were given filters to make queries and also some provided code by the company itself for the dashboard that we had to work around. In the future, I would use the same technique of following guidelines well, or asking for more information if necessary. We do not want to leave anything open ended.

  3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  Computer scientists do many things, from developing software, data management and analysis, algorithm creation, system design and engineering, and security. These are all some things besides database managment / creation / server/client work. These all are extremely important in keeping a business running efficiently. Computers allow much more powerful things to be done with data. Work on client server interaction like this is very useful for future understanding of a job in the CS field, as code crearion, database management, and dashboards are all used within many fields.
